# Chapter 13: Server Side: Java

These techniques are required only for those who need or want to build their own server from the ground up.

## 13.1 Opening a Server Socket for Business

### Problem

You need to write a socket-based server.

### Solution

Create a ServerSocket for the given port number.

## 13.2 Finding Network Interfaces

### Problem

You wish to find out about the computer’s networking arrangements.

### Solution

Use the `NetworkInterface` class.

## 13.3 Returning a Response (String or Binary)

### Problem

You need to write a string or binary data to the client.

### Solution

Use the `InputStream` and `OutputStream` from the socket.

## 13.4 Returning Object Information Across a Network Connection

### Problem

You need to return an object across a network connection.

### Solution

Create the object you need, and write it using an `ObjectOutputStream` created on top of the socket’s output stream.

## 13.7 Securing a Web Server with SSL and JSSE

### Problem

You want to protect your network traffic from malicious modification while the data is in transit.

### Solution

Use the Java Secure Socket Extension, JSSE, to encrypt your traffic.

> You MUST have set up a server certificate or you will get `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: no cipher suites in common`

## 13.8 Creating a REST Service with JAX-RS

### Problem

You want to implement a RESTful server by using the provided Java EE/Jakarta EE APIs.

### Solution

Use JAX-RS annotations on a class that provides a service; install it in an enterprise application server.
