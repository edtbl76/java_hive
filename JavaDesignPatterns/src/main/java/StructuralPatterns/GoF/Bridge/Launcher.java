            This is represents the power of the Bridge Pattern.
            Our abstractions are defined polymorphically as "Servers".

            However, when we need to use autoStart(), which only exists in the DatabaseServer() (refined abstraction)
            we can change the abstraction AT RUNTIME by casting.

            Most inspections/IDE are going to recommend narrowing the above declaration's variable type to DatabaseServer
            in the first place, but nonetheless this is one of the powers of the Bridge pattern.
