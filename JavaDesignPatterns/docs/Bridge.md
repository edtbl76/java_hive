# Bridge 

## Definition
"The decoupling of an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can
vary independently"

## Discussion
I placed that definition in quotes because I'm citing it from pretty much every 
design pattern book ever written. 

This pattern has had a number of different names. It is very well-travelled in 
API design. 

Separating an abstraction from its implementation is more than just creating an 
interface/abstract class. The bridge pattern assumes we've already done that. 

Here we are more or less allowing them to grow separately into two completely different
object hierarchies. 
- the abstraction is subclassed into "refined abstractions"
- the implementation is subclassed into "concrete implementation"

So where does the bridge come in? It's the glue code we create that connects the
abstraction and the implementation.. at runtime.. in the client. 

Another important concept is that "old school" subclassing/inheritance is NOT 
part of the bridge pattern. subclassing is a compile-time relationship, which
restricts the dynamic independence we want to achieve (i.e. runtime variance) 


### CONS
- it can be confused with other patterns (State pattern, Adapter pattern are
probably the most common)
- It becomes complicated very quickly.

## Implementation Details
ABSTRACTION<br>
The abstraction defines the abstract interface (i.e. Interface or abstract class)
- a salient point here is that it maintains a references to the Implementor

REFINED ABSTRACTION <br>
These are concrete classes that extend the interface of the abstraction. 

IMPLEMENTOR<br>
This is also an interface/abstract class that defines an interface for implementation
classes

CONCRETE IMPLEMENTOR<br>
These are concrete classes that extend the interface of the IMPLEMENTOR.

If you look carefully at the design, the Bridge pattern is "almost" a composite
of a typical abstract <-> concrete relationship. 
- In its simplest form we have an abstraction (i.e. an interface or abstract class) 
and a concrete implementation, which are classes that implement/extend the abstraction.
- the bridge pattern elaborates on this by creating "subsidiary" objects to each of 
those layers. 
    - the abstraction grows its own implementation
    - the implementation grows its own abstraction. 
    - by doing this, the entirety of the two layers are further separated, creating
    the desired flexibility. 



## Diagram

## Recommended Use
The main purpose of using the bridge pattern is to create "more distance" between 
an abstraction and its implementation so that they may vary independently. 
- This primarily means that a change in one should NOT break the other. 
- This is EXTREMELY critical to API design. The endpoints of an API are documented
and publicized. Customers rely on the quality and stability of that API for their
livelihood. Breakages in the API are damaging to a companies reputation (which hits
them in the pocket book.)
    - Telling developers that they can't "change" anything isn't going to fly, so
    the bridge pattern allows refactoring and redesign to happen within the
    implementation/underlying runtime without impacting the abstraction (the
    endpoints and interfaces being presented to paying customers.)
