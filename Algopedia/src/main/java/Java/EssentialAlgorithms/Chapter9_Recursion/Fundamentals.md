# Fundamentals of Recursion

DIRECT RECURSION
- when a method calls itself

INDIRECT RECURSION
- when a method calls another method that calls the initial 
method (creating a triangular/circular relationship)

## TREES
Trees are recursive by nature.
- algorithms that build, draw and search trees are usually 
recursive

## Two Requirements For All Recursive Algorithms
1. every time the method executes, it reduces the problem
 to a smaller instance of the SAME PROBLEM, and then calls 
 itself again to solve the smaller problem
1. recursion has to stop :)
