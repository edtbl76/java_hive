# Selections and Permutations
Selection/Combination
- a subset of a set of objects
- ordering doesn't matter so (a, b) == (b, a)

    
    EX:
        set {A, B, C}
        subsets {A,B}, {B, C} and {A,C}
        
Permuations
- these are an ordered arrangement of a subset of items
taken from a set. 


    EX: 
        set {A, B, C}
        permutations:
            (A, B)
            (A, C)
            (B, A)
            (B, C)
            (C, A)
            (C, B)
        
        
## NOTATIONS

{} are used for UNORDERED selections (Selection/Combination)
