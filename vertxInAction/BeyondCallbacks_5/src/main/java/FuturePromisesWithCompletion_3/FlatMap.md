# FLatMap
Operator commonly used in functional programming that basically means
- "and then"

It comes from flatten() and map() operators
    - flatten takes a multi-dimensional structure and flattens it down to one dimension
    - map evaluates each item of a collection against an operation, creating a 
    new collection with the results of those operations.
