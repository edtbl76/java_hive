# 1 Retrospective on Software Quality and Java Testing

## Sections

### Software Quality
- status quo in QE (Quality Engineering)
    - QA (Quality Assurance)
    - ISO/IEC-2500 
    - V & V (Verification and Validation)
    - Software Defects (BUGS!)
    
### Software Testing
- most common tasks to
    - guarantee software quality (more accurately to "increase confidence")
    - reduce number of software defects


- establish testing levels
    - unit
    - integration
    - system
    - acceptance
  
    
- establish test approaches
    - blackbox
    - whitebox
    - non-functional/cross-functional
  
    
- differentiate between automated and manual testing


### JVM Testing Frameworks
- summarizes main features of legacy JUnit versions (3&4)
- brief description of alternative testing frameworks
- brief description of "enhancers" of JUnit
