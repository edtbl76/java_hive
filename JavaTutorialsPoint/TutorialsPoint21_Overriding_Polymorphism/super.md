# SUPER KEYWORD

    - when a method is overridden, the super() keyword is used to access
    the method that has been overridden (i.e. we are sort of reverse overriding
    the overridding method w/ the method that was overridden to begin with.) 
    - the easier way of saying it is that the super keyword gives access to the 
    parent/super class method from the inherited object.
