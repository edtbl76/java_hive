# Constructors

    Initializes an object when it is instantiated
    
    it must have the SAME NAME of the class.
    
    NO RETURN TYPE
    
    Constructors can have "no arguments" or they may be
    "parametrized"
    
    All classes have constructors. (Java creates a
    default constructor if you don't write one)
    
    - NOTE: your constructor is a way of overriding
    the default construcgtor. 
    
    - Use case
        - to set initial values to instance variables
        defined by the class. 
        
        - perform setup procedures required to build
        fully formed object
