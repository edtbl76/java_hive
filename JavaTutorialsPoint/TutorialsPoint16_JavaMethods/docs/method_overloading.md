# Method Overloading

    - when a class has 2 or more methods by the same name, w/ different parameters. 
    (same name, but different use cases) 
    
    
    
### Overriding

    - same method name, type, number of parameters, etc.
    (everything is the same, but typically overriding involves the same method from
    different hierarchies.. i.e. parent/children)
