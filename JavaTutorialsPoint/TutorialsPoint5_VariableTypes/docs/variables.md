# Java Variables

    named storage (memory) that programs/apps can do stuff with. 
    
    TYPE
        - this determines the size and layout/structure of the 
        variable's memory. 
        - determines range of values that can be stored in the 
        memory
        - determines a set of operations that can be applied
        to transform or operate against that variable. 
        
        
    RULES:
        - variables MUST be declared before they can be used. 
    
        EX: data type variable [ = value][, variable [ = value]...];
        
            data type = "Java data tupe"
            variable  = supported variable name
            
            
   
   Examples
   
        int a, b, c         (Comma separated list, declaration only) 
        int a = 10, b = 10  (Example of initialization)
