# Java Literals

    - a literal is a source code representation of a fixed value
    - represented DIRECTLY in code w/o any computation. 
    
    
    EX: 
        byte a = 71;
        char b = 'B';
        
# Number Prefixes for integral literals

(all supported for byte, int, long, and short)

int decimal = 15;
int octal   = 017;  (0 prefix is for octal)
int hex     = 0x0F; (0x prefix is for hex) 

# String\Char Literals

String literals use double quotes

    "String Literal"
    "This is a \"String Literal\""  (escaping the quotes) 
    
Char literals use single quotes

    'a'
