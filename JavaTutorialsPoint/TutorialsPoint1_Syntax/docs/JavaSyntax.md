# JAVA SYNTAX

    Case Sensitive

    Class Names use 'TitleCase'     EX: MyClass

    Method Names use 'CamelCase'    EX: myMethod

    Program File Name   MUST MATCH THE CLASS NAME EXACTLY

    Program processing begins at main method

            public static void main(String args[])


# JAVA IDENTIFIERS

    All identifiers may begin with :
        - any upper case letter (A-Z)
        - any lower case letter (a-z)
        - a currency character ($)
        - an underscore (_)
        - (NOTE: THis does NOT include numbers)

    After the first character, identifiers can have ANY combination of characters

    A java 'key word' can't be used as an identifier.

    Identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE


# JAVA MODIFIERS

    Access Modifiers:       default, public, protected, private
    Non-Access Modifiers:   Final, abstract, strictfp
    
    package-private is a modifier that uses NO keyword (i.e. int booger would just be int booger)
        - This is also known as 'no modifier' 
        
    public access       = Class, Package, Subclass, World
    protected access    = Class, Package, Subclass
    package-private     = Class, Package
    private access      = Class only


# JAVA VARIABLES

    Class Variables     (Static Variables)
    Instance Variables  (Non-Static Variables)
