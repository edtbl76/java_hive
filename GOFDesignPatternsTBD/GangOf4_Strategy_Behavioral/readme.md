# STRATEGY PATTERN

    BEHAVIORAL PATTERN
    
        - a class behavior (or its algorithm) can be changed at runt ime. 
        - objects are created which represent various strategies
        - a context object is created whose behaviors varies as per its
        strategy objext
        - strategy object changes executing algorithm of the context obj.
        
### IMPLEMENTATION

    - Strategy interface defines an action and concrete strategy classes
    - Context is a class which consumes the Strategy interface and its implementers
