# Iterator Pattern

    BEHAVIORAL PATTERN
    
        - used to get a way to access the elements of a collection 
        object in a sequential manner w/o any need to know its 
        underlying representation. 
        
### Implementation

    - Iterator iterface that narrates navigation method
    - Container interface which returns the Iterator
    - Concrete classes implementing Container will be responsible to 
    use/implement Iterator
