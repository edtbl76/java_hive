# Facade Pattern

    - STRUCTURAL PATTERN
    
        - hides complexities of system, providing an interface to the client
        using which, the client can access the system. 
        
        - single class which provides simplified methods by the client and 
        delegates calls to methods of existing system classes
        
### Implementation

    - Shape interface w/ concrete classes implementing Shape interface
    - facade (ShapeMaker) uses Concrete classes to delegate user calls
