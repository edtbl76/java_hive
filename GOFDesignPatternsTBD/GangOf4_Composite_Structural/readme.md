# Composite Design Pattern

    - STRUCTURAL PATTERN
    
        - used where we need to treat a group of objects in a similar way
        as a single object
        
        - creates a class that contains a group of its own objects
        - the class provides ways to modify its group of same objects
        
### Implementation

    - class Employee which acts as composite pattern actor
