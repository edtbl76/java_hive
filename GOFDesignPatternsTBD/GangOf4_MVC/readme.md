# MVC Pattern

    - MODEL
        - represents on object or Java POJO carrying data. 
        - may include logic to update controller if its data changes
        
    - VIEW
        - represents the visualization of the data that the model 
        contains
        
    - CONTROLLER
        - acts on both model and view
        - controls data flow into model objects
        - updates view whenever data changes. 
        - keeps model and view separate.
