# Comments and Performance
- only for human consumption
- ignored by compiler and aren't included in the bytecode (.class file)

## Best Practices
- avoid unnecessary comments
- if code needs more than normal explanation, refactor your code. 
- comments should have uniform indentation and match for best readability
- use simple language... they are for other people to read. 
- ALWAYS add doc comments in source code.
