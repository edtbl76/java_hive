# ENCAPSULATION
- wrapping data and methods inside classes in combination w/ impl hiding (through 
access control)
- result is a DATA TYPE w/ CHARACTERISTICS and BEHAVIORS

- information hiding (abstraction of variables)
- implementation hiding (abstraction of business logic)

# WHY HIDE?
- establishes what client developers can and can't use.
- separates INTERFACE from IMPLEMENTATION

## ENCAPSULATION vs. ABSTRACTION

    - Abstraction = WHAT A CLASS CAN DO
    - Encapsulation = HOW TO ACHIEVE IT.
