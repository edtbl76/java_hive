# ABSTRACTION  ENCAPSULATION RELATIONSHIP
- these two concepts work together very closely. 
- technically they depend on each other. 
    - by encapsulating ATTRIBUTES and BEHAVIORS inside a class, we are encapsulating those
    class members within the class. 
    - in order to abstract the behaviors/attributes of an object from developers, we 
    encapsulate them within an object. 
    
- I like to think of it this way:

    - ABSTRACTION is the desired result (the what)
    - ENCAPSULATION is the method we achieve it (the how)
