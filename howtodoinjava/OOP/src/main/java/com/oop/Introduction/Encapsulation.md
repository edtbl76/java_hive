# ENCAPSULATION
- wrapping data and methods within classes in COMBINATION w/ info/impl hiding

INFORMATION HIDING is performed in two ways
1. via ACCESS CONTROL MODIFIERS 
    1. public, private, protected, package-private  
1. via mutators/accessors. 
    1. we don't interact directly w/ data. we interact w/ special methods designed to 
    access/operate against the data. 
    
   
    NOTE: this is demonstrated in InformationHiding class. 
    
IMPLEMENTATION HIDING
- implemention hiding is the creation of methods that perform behaviors
associated w/ the object. 
    - the behaviors USUALLY will interact w/ the attributes or properties inside the 
    class, but it isn't necessary. 

- the data types encapsulated within an object are referred to "members" of the class
    - METHODS are member functions
    - FIELDS are member variables.
