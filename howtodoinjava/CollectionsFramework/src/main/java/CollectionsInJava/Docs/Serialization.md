# Serialization
This is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 
- platform independent byte stream, so it should be able to be reconstructed
on a separate platform. 


# DESERIALIZATION
The reverse of serialization, such that a byte stream is used to recreate the 
actual Java object in memory.
