# Generic Type Class or Interface
A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables
- these vars are known as TYPE PARAMETERS of the class.

see DemoClass() example
- since the type is declared as Object, we have no good way to enforce type safety restrictions

see BetterDemoClass() example
- this uses a GENERIC type parameter that can enforce type safety.
